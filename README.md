# RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout---WEEK-6

This week's learning was focused on a comprehensive, end-to-end exploration of the open-source digital ASIC design flow, from high-level architecture down to the specifics of physical layout and verification. The journey began with an introduction to the RISC-V instruction set architecture and the physical context of a QFN-48 package, bridging the gap between software applications and the hardware they run on. A complete overview of the open-source digital ASIC design ecosystem was provided, setting the stage for a deep dive into the simplified RTL2GDS flow using tools like OpenLANE. The core principles of physical design were introduced, starting with floorplanning concepts such as utilization factor, aspect ratio, pre-placed cells, and power planning strategies involving de-coupling capacitors. This foundational knowledge was then extended to cell placement, timing analysis, and the critical role of standard cell libraries.

# Conclusion

In summary, this week's study successfully documented the entire path from a high-level RISC-V concept to a fully routed and verified physical design. A detailed examination of the OpenLANE flow was completed, covering floorplanning, placement optimization, clock tree synthesis using H-Tree algorithms, and final routing with TritonRoute. A significant portion of the learning was also dedicated to the fundamentals behind the tools: how standard cells are designed, laid out, and characterized. This included hands-on SPICE simulations of a CMOS inverter to understand timing models, propagation delays, and power consumption. The fundamental fabrication steps, from N-well formation to multi-level metal interconnects, were also covered, providing a complete picture. The process concluded with the final verification steps, including Design Rule Check (DRC) and analyzing the final routed files, solidifying the entire RTL2GDS learning experience.
